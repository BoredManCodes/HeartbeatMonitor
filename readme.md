## Heartbeat Monitor
A rather simple project written in C# (bear in mind this is my first C# program please go easy on me)
This is a Windows Forms App that makes a request to a heartbeat URL at the predefined interval.

Should be compatible with any uptime service that allows for heartbeat requests ie. [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com), [UptimeKuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma)

Now with run on startup support and if using UptimeKuma the program now checks if the server sucessfully acknowledged heartbeat ![PutinWOW](https://github.com/BoredManCodes/HeartbeatMonitor/blob/main/wow.png)
